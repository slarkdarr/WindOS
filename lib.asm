;void putInMemory (int segment, int address, char character)
_putInMemory:
	push bp
	mov bp,sp
	push ds

;int interrupt (int number, int AX, int BX, int CX, int DX)
_interrupt:
	push bp
	mov bp,sp
	mov ax,[bp+4]	;get the interrupt number in AL
	push ds		;use self-modifying code to call the right interrupt
	mov bx,cs
	mov ds,bx
	mov si,intr
	mov [si+1],al	;change the 00 below to the contents of AL
	pop ds
	mov ax,[bp+6]	;get the other parameters AX, BX, CX, and DX
	mov bx,[bp+8]
	mov cx,[bp+10]
	mov dx,[bp+12]

intr:	int 0x00	;call the interrupt (00 will be changed above)

	;mov ah,0	;we only want AL returned
	pop bp
	ret

;this is called to start a program that is loaded into memory
;void launchProgram(int segment)
_launchProgram:
	mov bp,sp
	mov bx,[bp+2]	;get the segment into bx

	mov ax,cs	;modify the jmp below to jump to our segment
	mov ds,ax	;this is self-modifying code
	mov si,jump
	mov [si+3],bx	;change the first 0000 to the segment

	mov ds,bx	;set up the segment registers
	mov ss,bx
	mov es,bx

	mov sp,0xfff0	;set up the stack pointer
	mov bp,0xfff0

jump:	jmp 0x0000:0x0000	;and start running (the first 0000 is changed above)
